# Opera GX Gaming Theme Presets

A list of all the available set of colors and backgrounds for Opera GX Gaming Theme for Discord.

*Don't know where to go? Just start with the [Classic](https://github.com/GX-Hacker/discord-themes/tree/main/Opera-GX-Gaming-Theme/01_Classic) one!*

:warning: Required files for Powercord will come later, they're not made yet. You can still use the [Old Classic](https://github.com/GX-Hacker/discord-themes/tree/main/Opera-GX-Gaming-Theme/archive/00_OldClassic) theme, but you need a bit of advanced knowledge for other presets.
