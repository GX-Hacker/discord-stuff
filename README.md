# [GX Hacker](https://github.com/GX-Hacker) Discord Themes

Here you can get themes and mini-themes to use with the Discord desktop/browser app!

## For newbies

You're invited to [read the wiki](https://github.com/gx-hacker/home/wiki) to learn how to download, install and use a theme!

## Which mod/extension to use and which files to download?

To download a file on GitHub, you have to click on the file name, then "Raw", then save using Ctrl + S.

### BetterDiscord

Simply go to the theme folder (e.g. AMOLED Dark Theme) and just download the `.theme.css` file. Then place it in your theme folder.

### Stylus

Go to the theme folder, click on the `.theme.css` file, click "Raw", copy everything (Ctrl + A and Ctrl + C), and paste in a new style. Name it, and **make sure to ONLY apply it for `discord.com`.**

WARNING: Discord themes on Firefox **may not work** because of priority levels.

### Powercord

Powercord is still not tested for a long time, but it's there. Go to the themes folder, create a subfolder with the theme name (e.g. AMOLED Dark theme). In this folder you'll have to place the `.theme.css` AND the `powercord_manifest.json` files which you download from this repo.

## Mobile?

You can't use these themes in the mobile app, because it is made totally differently. You can still try using a browser that supports Chrome extensions, like [Kiwi Browser](https://kiwibrowser.com), install [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne), and use the browser version of Discord. Don't be surprised if it lags on low end phones/tablets. For mobile it is more recommended to use [browser styles](https://github.com/gx-hacker/browser-styles) for other websites instead of these themes. Works for Android, good luck on iOS.
